# Brutalist Theme for Obsidian

![Brutalist Dark Mode](screenshot.png)

A stark, geometric theme for Obsidian that prioritises function and raw aesthetics over softness. This theme removes rounded corners in favour of a strictly angular, squared-off user interface.

## Key Features

* **Zero Radius UI:** All elements—including tabs, checkboxes, toggle switches, and status bar items—are square.
* **High Contrast Borders:**
    * **Dark Mode:** Features distinct white borders with **Orange** (#BA7428) accents and text.
    * **Light Mode:** Features sharp black borders with **Blue** (#0066CC) accents and text.
* **Typography:** Headings utilise 'American Typewriter' for a mechanical, structured feel.
* **Custom Interface Elements:**
    * **Toggles:** Custom circular switches with pastel indicators (Red for off, Green for on).
    * **Checkboxes:** Fully square inputs, customised for both standard tasks and database plugins (Bases).
    * **Navigation:** High-visibility indentation lines in the file explorer (Blue in Light Mode).
* **Status Bar:** Minimalist container with boxed items and invisible outer borders.
