**What is it?**

**Brutalist is a theme designed specifically for heavy readers and writers.**

Its stark, geometric aesthetics prioritise function and raw form over embellishment. The interface features a strictly angular, squared-off architecture, eliminating rounded corners for a precise, purposeful appearance. The colour scheme utilises low-contrast shades of grey and restrained accents, engineered to maintain focus and minimise visual strain during prolonged sessions. As the name suggests, the aesthetic derives from Brutalist architecture: honest, utilitarian, and bold.

**Design Philosophy**

The objective was to create a comfortable environment that facilitates focused reading and note creation through a low-distraction, text-centric interface. This aids deep work by removing visual clutter.

* **Dark Mode:** Inspired by dedicated reading applications such as Instapaper and Safari’s 'Reader View', the palette is calibrated for optimal comfort in low-light conditions.
* **Light Mode:** Offers a distinct alternative for those who prefer a brighter interface, whilst strictly adhering to the core principles of text primacy and minimal visual interruption.

**Who is this theme for?**

This theme is tailored for individuals who dedicate significant time to reading notes or drafting content within Obsidian. It is particularly effective for users leveraging the Obsidian Web Clipper to manage long-form articles, treating the vault as a reading repository. Similarly, it provides writers and coders with an immersive environment conducive to focused output.
