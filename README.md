# Brutalist Theme for Obsidian
Compatible with Style Settings

**What is it?**

A stark, geometric theme for Obsidian that prioritises function and raw aesthetics over softness or embellishment. The theme features a strictly angular, squared-off user interface, eliminating all rounded corners for a precise, purposeful appearance. The colour scheme is defined by low-contrast shades of grey and an accentuating blue highlight, engineered to maintain focus and minimise visual strain. It is named 'Brutalist' because its main aesthetic inspiration is Brutalist architecture.

**Why I made it?**

The goal was to create a theme that prioritises focused reading and note creation by offering an exceptionally low-distraction, text-centric interface. This design is aimed at users who require deep work and minimal visual clutter.

The dark mode draws inspiration from focused reading applications such as Instapaper and Safari’s 'Reader View'. It features a low-contrast palette engineered for optimal reading comfort in varied lighting conditions.

The light mode serves as an alternative for users who prefer a slightly more varied colour scheme, while still maintaining the core design principles of text primacy and minimal visual interruption.

**Who is this theme for?**

The theme was designed for people who spend, or want to spend, significant time in Obsidian reading their notes. This is particularly useful for those who use Obsidian Web Clipper to save their articles and use Obsidian as a read-it-later app. It would also be useful for writers or coders who want to be focused, almost isolated from the world.
